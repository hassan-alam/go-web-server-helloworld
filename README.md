# Getting Started In Go: Creating a Simple HTTP Server

This is a github repo with the source code for this [blog post](https://halam.dev/getting-started-in-go/).

This is a simple Go application that starts an http server listening on port 8000 that will output "Hello World!" on `"/"`.

## Installing Go

Install Go by following the instructions on this [page](https://golang.org/doc/install).

## Running the Application

After installing Go, run the application by running the command `go run server.go` in the project directory for this repository.

## Hitting "Hello World!"

Just open up [`localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000), after starting the application.
